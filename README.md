# Chinese whispers: L Systems

**Participant**: This repository contains code used to run a code night based on Chinese Whispers concept. For a few iterations participants code for 10 minutes then pass their computer to the left in a circle. One new requirement per iteration is added. At the end code and approaches are compared and discussed.

**Faciliator**: the full instructions and solution are in the `solution` folder.

- Time spent explaining the exercise: 10 mins (including L-systems intro)
- Time spent in the exercise: 40 mins
- Time spent in discussion: 30 mins (**note:** Pizza ought to commence during this period)

## Requirements

Python 3

## Running the code

1. Download `l_system.py` file from this repository
2. Run `python3 l_system.py`
