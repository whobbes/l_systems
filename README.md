# Chinese whispers: L Systems

**Participant**: This repo contains code used to run a code night based on Chinese Whispers concept. For a few iterations participants code for 10 minutes then pass their computer to the left in a circle. One new requirement per iteration is added. At the end code and approaches are compared and discussed. The base code for the session is included in `l_system.py`

**Faciliator**: the full instructions and solution are in the `solution` folder.
